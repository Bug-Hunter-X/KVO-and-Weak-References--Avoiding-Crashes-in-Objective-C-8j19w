In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, especially when dealing with weak references.  If an observed object is deallocated while an observer is still registered, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is because the observer might try to access the deallocated object's properties, resulting in a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  This is particularly problematic if the observer itself is also deallocated, causing a double-free scenario.
